### **_Motivation_**

Our motivation for this collaborative project was to refine our programming acumen; building on our existing knowledge of React, Express, and JavaScript, while integrating the additional technologies of the PostgreSQL database, and user authentication methods. We accomplished this together after only eight weeks of instruction enrolled in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program.
